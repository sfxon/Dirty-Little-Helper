# Coding Standards

## 1. PHP

At the moment, this project uses PHP-CS-Fixer as a tool to help following standards.
As symfony is used as a framework, and symfony supports php-cs-fixer, the default symfony way of integration was chosen.
Information about this way of integration can be found here:

* https://cs.symfony.com/
* https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer

There is also an additional documentation file (```php-cs-fixer.md```) in the projects doc folder, describing the way php-cs-fixer is used in this project.
